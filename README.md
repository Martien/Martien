- 👋 Hi, I’m @Martien
- 👀 I’m interested in http://observablehq.com/@martien/
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Observable, SVG, FP, JS, CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool dataviz projects
- 📫 Reach me via martien@aardrock.com

BTW, Nothing much on github from me, because everything I do I do in [Observable](http://observablehq.com/@martien/), and that abstracts it from me – Go Greyhound and Leave the Driving to Us.
<!---
Martien/Martien is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
